# [Title of project]

This repository describes our annotations for the project [XYZ]. In the project, we annotated metaphors in two datasets, namely, "Natur und Staat" [maybe a link and a description] and the German Reichtstagsprotokolle [maybe a link and a description]. 
We annotated according to two theories:

* Theory 1 ("Metaphernbruch"): short description    
* Theory 2 ("MIP"): short description
      
      
## Organization of the project
